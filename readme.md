# Tetris AI Project

## Overview

This project is an implementation of Tetris with an AI component. The game is fully playable by a human player, but the AI component is far from perfect.

## Features

- Fully functional Tetris game playable by human players
- Initial implementation of an AI agent using reinforcement learning
- Basic scoring system

## Project Structure

- `game.py`: Contains the main game logic and rendering
- `model.py`: Defines the AI model and agent
- `controller.py`: Manages the game loop and AI training process
- `structure.txt`: Outlines the basic structure of the AI input/output and reward system
- `stats.json`: Contains the AI's training statistics

## Current Status

The human-playable version of the game is fully functional. However, the AI component needs significant improvements:

- The reward system requires refinement
- The AI's performance is suboptimal and needs further training and tweaking

## Running the Game

To play the game:

1. Ensure you have Python and PyGame installed
2. Run `python game.py`

## Contributing

While I don't plan to continue working on this project, I welcome anyone who would like to pick up where I left off. If you're interested in improving the AI, refining the reward system, or enhancing the game in any way, feel free to submit a pull request.

Areas that could use improvement:

1. Refining the AI's reward system
2. Optimizing the AI model architecture
3. Improving the game's graphics and user interface
